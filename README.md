## Taskie - Frontend

### Tools - React Native and Expo

The Taskie Frontend Application is implemented with the React Native Framework.
To easily run the app in development mode, we have used the [Expo app](https://expo.io) -
a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to help us build
our native mobile project *Taskie* using JavaScript and React.
It is an interactive tool that automatically reload the changes on files,
and all build errors and logs are displayed in the terminal.

### Manual

To install the frontend tools and get started, please read the instructions in [dev_README.md](./dev_README.md)
